*foreword:* TheOctoPost is just at the beginning of its development; bugs may happen, display may be a bit odd.  

# What is TheOctoPost?
TheOctoPost can be seen as a blog engine, but it's not. It's a publishing platform but not a writing platform. You write your articles on your mac or pc, in your favourite text editor, you push that on GitHub, and then it show up on TheOctoPost!  

# How do I make content available on TheOctoPost?
1. Fork this repo (keep the name `myoctopost`, it's important!)
2. Create a folder in `articles/` for your fist article, using only lowercase letters and dashes instead of spaces
3. Create a `config.json` inside the folder you've just created (or copy-paste the one from the `getting-started` article)
4. Edit the fields of your fresh `config.json`
5. Create a `index.md` in the same folder
6. Write your aticle in `index.md`, using the Markdown syntax
7. Push that on your GitHub repo
8. Visit `https://theoctopress/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_ARTICLE_TITLE`

If your username on GitHub is `johnnybravo` and the folder name of your article (lowercase + dashes) is `my-fabulous-article`, then you can see and share your article at:  
`https://theoctopress/johnnybravo/my-fabulous-article`
